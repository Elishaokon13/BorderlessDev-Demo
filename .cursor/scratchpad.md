# POAP on Base - Workshop Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) application on Base using Base Minikit. This app will allow users to mint POAPs as proof of attending events/workshops. The project needs to be completed within a 3-hour workshop timeframe.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Time constraint (3 hours) - Need to focus on core functionality
2. Integration with Base network
3. Smart contract development and deployment
4. User-friendly frontend interface
5. Proper setup of Base Minikit

## High-level Task Breakdown

### Setup Phase
1. Initialize project with Base Minikit
   - Success Criteria: Project structure created with all necessary dependencies
   - Base Minikit properly configured

### Smart Contract Development
1. Create POAP smart contract
   - Success Criteria: Contract compiles successfully
   - Basic minting functionality implemented
   - Events emitted for tracking

### Frontend Development
1. Create basic UI components
