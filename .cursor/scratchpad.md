# POAP on Base - Workshop Project

## Background and Motivation
Building a POAP (Proof of Attendance Protocol) application on Base using Base Minikit. This app will allow users to mint POAPs as proof of attending events/workshops. The POAP will be implemented as a Soulbound Token (SBT) with a limit of 1 per address, ensuring each attendee can only have one non-transferable token. The project needs to be completed within a 3-hour workshop timeframe, focusing on core functionality while leveraging Base Minikit's built-in features.

## Workshop Details
- Name: "BUILD ON BASE CHALLENGE - BORDERLESS WORKSHOPS"
- Type: Workshop Attendee Badge
- Visual: Blue circular badge with Base home icon
- Metadata Storage: On-chain
- Start Date: June 16, 2025 (1718553600) // Unix timestamp
- End Date: June 25, 2025 (1719331200) // Unix timestamp
- Network: Base Testnet
- **Contract Address: 0xd3F581adEF8b654b7ed08F3aD43fEd0fC359b117**

## Key Challenges and Analysis
1. Time constraint (3 hours) - Need to focus on core functionality
2. Integration with Base network and Base Minikit
3. Smart contract development and deployment via Remix
4. Implementation of SBT functionality (non-transferable tokens)
5. User-friendly frontend interface with Base Minikit components
6. Proper setup of Base Minikit and environment configuration

## Technical Stack
1. Base Minikit for core functionality
2. Next.js for frontend framework
3. Tailwind CSS for styling
4. Solidity for smart contract (ERC721 with SBT modifications)
5. OnchainKit for blockchain interactions
6. Remix IDE for smart contract deployment
